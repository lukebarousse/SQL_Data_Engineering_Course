Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data engineers:
SQL and Python are by far the most in-demand skills, with around 29,000 job postings each - nearly double the next closest skill.
Cloud platforms round out the top skills, with AWS leading at ~18,000 postings, followed by Azure at ~14,000.
Apache Spark completes the top 5 with nearly 13,000 postings, highlighting the importance of big data processing skills.

Key takeaways:
- SQL and Python remain the foundational skills for data engineers
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) are critical for modern data engineering
- Big data tools like Spark continue to be highly valued
- Data pipeline tools (Airflow, Snowflake, Databricks) show growing demand
- Java and GCP round out the top 10 most requested skills
